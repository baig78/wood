    <p class="about-text">Please tell your friends about Jimdel-Edu Channel. Thank you. You can find different Tutorial such as PHP CRUD,
        Rating System, Shopping Cart, etc. Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to
        generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,
        injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
        opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
